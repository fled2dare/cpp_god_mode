# C and C++ notes

## Primitive data type:

All the data types in C and C++, we can categorize them into different groups: **fundamental (or primitive) data types**, **derived data types**, **user-defined data types**, and **additional types provided by C++**. Here's how you can explain them:

### 1. **Fundamental Data Types (Primitive Types)**
These are the basic types provided by the language:

- **C and C++**:
  - `char`: Represents a single character (typically 1 byte).
  - `int`: Represents an integer value (size varies based on system, e.g., 2 or 4 bytes).
  - `float`: Represents a floating-point number (typically 4 bytes).
  - `double`: Represents a double-precision floating-point number (typically 8 bytes).
  - `void`: Represents the absence of type (used for functions that don't return a value).
  - `bool` (C++ only): Represents a boolean value, `true` or `false` (added in C++).

- **Additional Variants**:
  - **Signed and Unsigned Types**:
    - `signed char`, `unsigned char`
    - `signed int`, `unsigned int`
    - `signed short`, `unsigned short`
    - `signed long`, `unsigned long`
    - `signed long long`, `unsigned long long` (C99 and C++11)

### 2. **Derived Data Types**
These are built from the fundamental types:

- **C and C++**:
  - **Pointers**: `int*`, `char*`, `float*`, etc.
  - **Arrays**: `int arr[10]`, `char name[20]`, etc.
  - **Functions**: Return types and parameter types are defined.
  - **References** (C++ only): `int&`, `char&`, etc.

### 3. **User-Defined Data Types**
These are created by the programmer:

- **C and C++**:
  - `struct`: Combines different types into a single entity.
  - `union`: Similar to `struct`, but all members share the same memory location.
  - `enum`: Enumeration types for defining named integer constants.

- **C++ Only**:
  - **Classes**: Similar to `struct`, but with the addition of member functions and more features (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).
  - **`typedef` and `using`**: Used to define new names for existing types.
  - **`std::string`**: A class for handling sequences of characters more easily than C-style strings.

### 4. **Additional Data Types (C99 and C++ Standards)**
- **C99 Added Types**:
  - `long long int`: For larger integer types.
  - **Fixed-Width Integers**: `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `int32_t`, `int64_t`, and their unsigned versions from `<stdint.h>`.
  - `bool` (via `<stdbool.h>`)

- **C++ Adds Many More Types**:
  - **`std::string`**: A more powerful string handling class.
  - **Containers and Iterators** (STL): `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map`, etc.
  - **Smart Pointers**: `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, etc.
  - **Wide Character Types**: `wchar_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`.
  - **Type Aliases**: `decltype`, `auto`, `std::nullptr_t`, etc. (C++11 onwards)

### Summary
1. **C**:
   - Fundamental types: `char`, `int`, `float`, `double`, `void`, etc.
   - Derived types: Pointers, arrays, functions.
   - User-defined types: `struct`, `union`, `enum`, `typedef`.
   - Additional (C99): `long long`, fixed-width integers.

2. **C++**:
   - All C types.
   - Extra fundamental type: `bool`.
   - More advanced user-defined types: Classes, `std::string`, smart pointers, etc.
   - Features from newer standards: `decltype`, `auto`, `nullptr`, smart pointers, wide characters, etc.

This breakdown should help you give a comprehensive answer if asked about the various data types in C and C++. You can also mention how the standards have evolved (e.g., C99, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20) if the interviewer dives deeper.
